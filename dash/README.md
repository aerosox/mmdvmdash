# What is placed here?

This directory contains the files of the web-frontend. You have to put these
files in your webserver on same machine as the python-backend.

You have to modify the file **mmdvmdash_tools.php** and edit the path 
to sqlite-database like set in mmdvm_parser.ini.

Make shure, that your webserver has read-access to the database-file. 
Write-access is actually not needed.
